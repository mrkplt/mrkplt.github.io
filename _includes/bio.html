<h2 id='bio'>Introduction</h2>
<p>My name is Mark Platt. I live in the suburbs of Philadelphia with my wife and our four cats. I like to be surrounded by people who are smarter and more capable than me. I like surprises, unless I find out about them. I graduated from <a href="http://www.drexel.edu">Drexel</a> a million years ago for information technology.</p>
<p>I'm basically a good dude, you can ask around.</p>
