<h2 id='bio'>Who are you?</h2>
<p>My name is Mark Platt. I live in the suburbs of Philadelphia with my wife and two cats. <strike>I subscribe to the idea of <a href='http://bobsutton.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/07/strong_opinions.html'>strong opinions, weakly held</a></strike>. I like to be surrounded by people who are smarter and more capable than me. I like surprises, unless I find out about them. I'm basically a good dude, you can ask around.</p>
