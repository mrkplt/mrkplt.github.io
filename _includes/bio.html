<h2 id='bio'>Who are you?</h2>
<p>My name is Mark Platt. I'm a <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> developer living in the suburbs of Philadelphia. I'm married, we have two cats and our apartment is in a building we own. I'm loud and opinionated; I will also admit readily when I am wrong. I like surprises, unless I find out about them. I'm basically a good dude, you can ask around.</p>
