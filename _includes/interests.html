  <p>I play games. Mostly video games and table top RPG's, but I'm also into board games, and dabble in TCG's every few years. I recently took up Warhammer: Age of Sigmar, and have a lot of points of unpainted Skaven sitting on my shelf. I play in a weekly-ish D&amp;D game game with a bunch of folks I have known for a really long time. I'm a pretty big nerd, and I'm pretty happy with that.</p>

  <p>I'm a synth dude even though I'm not much of a musician anymore. I waste a lot of time on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_synthesizer">modular synths</a>. I'm in the quickly diminishing frac camp and I'm thinking of going euro. I have a module that detects radiation. You can see <a href="https://www.modulargrid.net/f/racks/view/268380">the synths current layout</a> if you're interested.</p>

  <p>Our cats are Sam, Charlie, Panther and Half-Panther. Sam and Charlie are older tuxedo brothers. Panther and Half-Panther are foster fails. Sam is my best friend. Charlie is the neediest cat in history. We call the kittens "the kittens" but they are fully grown cats.</p>
