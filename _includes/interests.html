<h2 id='interests'>Do you do anything interesting?</h2>
  <p>I play games. Mostly video games and table top RPG's, but I'm also into board games, and dabble in TCG's every few years. I play in a weekly-ish D&amp;D game game with a bunch of folks I have known for a really long time.</p>

  <p>I'm a synth dude extraordinaire, I'm not much of a musician anymore, but I am still in love with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_synthesizer">modular synths</a>. If you're interested: I'm in the frac camp, I am thinking of going euro though. My synth only has three rows. I have a module that detects radiation.</p>

  <p>Our cats are Sam, Charlie, Panther and Half-Panther. Sam and Charlie are older tuxedo brothers. Panther and Half-Panther are foster fails. We call them the kittens but they are fully grown cats.</p>
