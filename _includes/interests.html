<h2 id='interests'>Interests</h2>
  <p>My hobbies and interests are constantly changing, and if I'm being honest I can't really keep track of them. Over the years the ones that have remained consistent are music, games, and cats.</p>

  <p>I play some games. Mostly video games and table top RPG's, but I'm also into board games, and dabble in TCG's every few years. I've been playing  taken up Age of Sigmar for a few years now. Mostly I play Ogors and Skaven, they're both gross. Some of my models are even painted. I'm a pretty big nerd, and I'm pretty happy with that.</p>

  <p>Everybody loves music, so it seems trite to say it, but I am unsurprisingly also fond of music. I play a little, and sporadically. I listen to a lot. I'm mostly into black metal and sludge/stoner/doom these days. I've been in some bands, one of them was described as being "like a young Throbbing Gristle," and that was one of the greatest compliments I have ever received.</p>

  <p>Our cats are Sam, Charlie, Panther and Half-Panther. Sam and Charlie are older tuxedo brothers. Panther and Half-Panther are foster fails. Sam is my best friend. Charlie is the neediest cat in history. We call the kittens "the kittens" but they are fully grown cats. I've been to a cat convention.</p>
