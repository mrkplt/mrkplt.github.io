<p>
  I'm a Manager and Software Architect with a strong background in IT, consulting, ecommerce, and agency work. I bring insights about processes, cost, timelines, staffing, team resourcing, and culture building to the table.  
</p>
<p>
  I work for <a href="https://bdtrust.org/">Benefits Data Trust</a> steering our application ecosystem towards the larger organizational goals through collaboration, vision, and hands on development. 
</p>
  I'm probably available to do all sorts of consulting so drop me a line if you need a hand.
