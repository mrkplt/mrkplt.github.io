<h2 id='work'>Work</h2>
<p>
  I'm a Manager and Software Architect with a strong background in IT, consulting, ecommerce, and agency work. I bring insights about processes, cost, timelines, staffing, team resourcing, and culture building to the table. I tend to thrive in smaller, scrappier, messier environments. I'm pretty good at growing teams of talented developers through careful and consistent interviewing practices. I intend to pursue my career down the management track, but I also understand it's a career jungle gym, not a career ladder.

<p>
  I work for <a href="https://bdtrust.org/">Benefits Data Trust</a> steering our application ecosystem towards the larger organizational goals through collaboration, vision, and hands on development. 
</p>
<p>
  I'm available to do all sorts of consulting so drop me a line if you need a hand. You could just drop me a line if you want to talk.
