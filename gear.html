<h2>Gear Sale</h2>
<p>
  I have too many things and not enough money. Shipping is on the buyer, if you're in the Philly metro area I will deliver. Picture/more details are always available. Many of these items have not been turned on in years, it is entirely reasonable to ask me to test something if you're interested in it.

<p>
  Prices are negotiable, but are pretty reasonable as it is.
